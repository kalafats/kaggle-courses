### Load the data
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option("display.max_rows", 5)
reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv", index_col=0)

### What is the median of the `points` column in the `reviews` DataFrame?
median_points = reviews.points.median()

### To see a list of unique values we can use the unique function:
reviews.taster_name.unique()

### To see the number of unique values we can use the unique function:
reviews.taster_name.nunique()

### To see a list of unique values and how often they occur in the dataset, we can use the value_counts method:
reviews.taster_name.value_counts()

### Create variable `centered_price` containing a version of the `price` column with the mean price subtracted.
centered_price = reviews.price - reviews.price.mean()

### Create a variable `bargain_wine` with the title of the wine with the highest points-to-price ratio in the dataset.
bargain_wine = reviews.title[(reviews.points / reviews.price).idxmax()]

### Is a wine more likely to be "tropical" or "fruity"? Create a Series `descriptor_counts` counting how many times each of these two words appears in the `description` column in the dataset.

tropical = reviews.description.map(lambda p: 'tropical' in p).sum()
fruity = reviews.description.map(lambda p: 'fruity' in p).sum()
descriptor_counts = pd.Series([tropical,fruity],index=['tropical','fruity'])
descriptor_counts
>tropical    3607
fruity      9090
dtype: int64

### Create a series `star_ratings` with the number of stars corresponding to each review in the dataset. A score of 95 or higher counts as 3 stars, a score of at least 85 but less than 95 is 2 stars. Any other score is 1 star.

def rescore(s):
    if s>=95:
        return 3
    elif s>=85:
        return 2
    else:
        return 1

star_ratings = reviews.points.apply(rescore)
