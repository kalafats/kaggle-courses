### Specify and compile the model
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, GlobalAveragePooling2D

num_classes = 2
resnet_weights_path = '../input/resnet50/resnet50_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5'

my_new_model = Sequential()
my_new_model.add(ResNet50(include_top=False, pooling='avg', weights=resnet_weights_path))
my_new_model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))

my_new_model.layers[0].trainable = False

my_new_model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

### Fit the model using the data augmentation
from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

image_size = 224

# Specify the values for all arguments to data_generator_with_aug.
data_generator_with_aug = ImageDataGenerator(preprocessing_function=preprocess_input,
                                              horizontal_flip = True,
                                              width_shift_range = 0.1,
                                              height_shift_range = 0.1)
            
data_generator_no_aug = ImageDataGenerator(preprocessing_function=preprocess_input)

# Why do we need both a generator with augmentation and a generator without augmentation? After thinking about it, check out the solution below.
# We want to do data augmentation when fitting the model for the reasons mentioned in the video (including a reduction in overfitting, by giving us more data to work with).

# But we don't want to change how we test the model. So the validation generator will use an ImageDataGenerator without augmentation. That allows a straightforward comparison between different training procedures (e.g. training with augmentation and without it).

# If the augmentation made it harder to predict the label associated with an image (e.g. because of how the image was cropped in augmentation) that would make it misleading to compare scores to another procedure where the validation data was only original images.
