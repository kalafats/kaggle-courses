### Load the data
# Path of the file to read
flight_filepath = "../input/flight_delays.csv"

# Read the file into a variable flight_data
flight_data = pd.read_csv(flight_filepath, index_col="Month")

### Plot barchart
# Say we'd like to create a bar chart showing the average arrival delay for Spirit Airlines (airline code: NK) flights, by month.

# Set the width and height of the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))

# Add title
plt.title("Average Arrival Delay for Spirit Airlines Flights, by Month")

# Bar chart showing average arrival delay for Spirit Airlines flights by month
sns.barplot(x=flight_data.index, y=flight_data['NK'])

# Add label for vertical axis
plt.ylabel("Arrival delay (in minutes)")

### Heatmap
# We have one more plot type to learn about: heatmaps!

# In the code cell below, we create a heatmap to quickly visualize patterns in flight_data. Each cell is color-coded according to its corresponding value.

# Set the width and height of the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(14,7))

# Add title
plt.title("Average Arrival Delay for Each Airline, by Month")

# Heatmap showing average arrival delay for each airline by month
sns.heatmap(data=flight_data, annot=True)

# Add label for horizontal axis
plt.xlabel("Airline")
