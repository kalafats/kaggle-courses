### Load data
import pandas as pd

reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv", index_col=0)
pd.set_option("display.max_rows", 5)

### Select the `description` column from `reviews` and assign the result to the variable `desc`.
desc = reviews.description

### select the first raw
first_row = reviews.iloc[0]

### select certain raws and assing to a new pandas frame
indices = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
sample_reviews = reviews.loc[indices]

### select certain cols and certain raws
df = reviews[['country','province','region_1','region_2']].iloc[[0,1,10,100]]

### Both loc and iloc are row-first, column-second. This is the opposite of what we do in native Python, which is column-first, row-second. This means that it's marginally easier to retrieve rows, and marginally harder to get retrieve columns. To get a column with iloc, we can do the following:

reviews.iloc[:, 0]

### Create a variable `df` containing the `country` and `variety` columns of the first 100 records.
df = reviews.loc[0:99,['country','variety']]

### Create a DataFrame `italian_wines` containing reviews of wines made in `Italy`
italian_wines = reviews[reviews.country == 'Italy']

### Create a DataFrame `top_oceania_wines` containing all reviews with at least 95 points (out of 100) for wines from Australia or New Zealand.
top_oceania_wines = reviews[reviews.country.isin(['Australia','New Zealand']) & (reviews.points >= 95)]
