### Load the data
import pandas as pd
reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv", index_col=0)
pd.set_option("display.max_rows", 5)

### Who are the most common wine reviewers in the dataset? Create a `Series` whose index is the `taster_twitter_handle` category from the dataset, and whose values count how many reviews each person wrote.

reviews_written = reviews.groupby('taster_twitter_handle').taster_twitter_handle.count()

### Create a `Series` whose index is wine prices and whose values is the maximum number of points a wine costing that much was given in a review. Sort the values by price, ascending (so that `4.0` dollars is at the top and `3300.0` dollars is at the bottom).

best_rating_per_price = reviews.groupby('price')['points'].max().sort_index()
